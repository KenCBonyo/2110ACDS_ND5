### Introduction
During this project, the team was mandated to develop a data analytics solution that would determine the load shortfall in Spain's electrical grid. The load shortfall was illustrated as the difference between renewable & non-renewable energy supply sources. The training dataset included the weather features for 5 key cities in Spain: Madrid, Valencia, Bilbao, Barcelona & Seville.

The following sections were included in the project development:
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Gathering insights from the training data.
- Feature Engineering: Improving the quality of the features in the dataset, & adding features as well.
- Model selection & Comparison: Developing different trained models & comparing their performance based on key metrics.
- Presentation of our solution to a panel of reviewers.

### Final Project Results

#### Training dataset insights
Relatively normally distributed data with a reliable matrix (m\*n) for ML development
#### Feature Engineering
- A lot of weather attributes showed correlation characteristics
- Specific features held higher importance in determining the load shortfall, necessitating dropping others.

#### Machine Learning Training
Multiple models were compared, the fairest performer being the RandomForest Regressor.

#### Project Insights
Specific weather attributes for specific cities are good determinants on the load shortfall values,  which may be due to these power plants being located near these cities. Thus monitoring these areas, the government of Spain can be adept to react on prospective cases of load shortfalls effectively.
